# NorthQuad Candidate Exercise
My entry into the NorthQuad interview process

## To Run:

1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run `init.sh` (sent to Colleen) to set environment variables for the AWS database I set up

3. Run the flask script in the root directory (`__init__.py`).

4. Make sure to have angular installed.

5. Run the frontend in the `static/` directory using `ng serve`.

6. Make sure you have a browser extension to disable CORS [such as this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)

Thats it!
